# the name of the function is add
# after the function name is a set of parentheses and that defines the parameters of the function
# each input is separated by a comma
# the colon after the function name indicates that this is a function definition
# the first line is the function signature
# the second line is the function body
# def is short for define
# input is defined by paranthesis 
# whatever is on the line of return is the output of the function
# the return statement is used to return a value from a function
# so the print function takes the body (return values ) and interprets them to print them to the console
# A function call is a variable that is defined by the function name and the parameters

# Call that function with the inputs 10 and 7, and print the output.
