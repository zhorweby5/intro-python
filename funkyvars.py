#What is Print?
# print is a function that takes an argument and prints it to the console
# print is a built in function that takes an argument and prints it to the console

def add(a, b):
    return a + b


print(add(1, 2))
# the name of the function is add
# affter the function name is a set of parentheses and that defines the parameters of the function
# each in[put is separated by a comma]
# the colon after the function name indicates that this is a function definition
# the first line is the function signature
# the second line is the function body
# def is short for define
# input is defined by paranthesis 
# whatever is on the line of return is the output of the function
# the return statement is used to return a value from a function
# so the print function takes the body (return values ) and interprets them to print them to the console
# A function call is a variable that is defined by the function name and the parameters

# Homework
# define a function named subtract. YOu can guess how it should work. 
# Call that function with the inputs 10 and 7, and print the output.
